Question 1:
	What are two reasons one might push code to a service like github?

Answer:
	Reason 1 - In order to maintain code redundancy, so if one were to lose
	           their code due to whatever reasons (accdiental deletion,
                   corruption, hardware failure, etc.), they are able to recover
		   their work from the github repo.
	Reason 2 - To share code efficiently among members of a group project.


Question 2:
	What is another VCS tool?

Answer:
	A quick Google search turned up BitBucket.org as another alternative to
	github's code repository.
