Claudine Gladue Lab 3 Assignment
Question 1:
One one might push code to a service like github is because it is an easy way to share large code sources with many people. I can just send a link to my code to someone to show them (or share so they can fork, or get shared to and fork…). 

Another reason to use a service like github is it is a good space/place to store code, in case your system is compromised/crashes. 

Question 2: 
Another VCS tool is bitbucket (bitbucket.org).
